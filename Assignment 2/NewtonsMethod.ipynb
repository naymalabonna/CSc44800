    "This notebook contains code to perform Newton’s Method. Newton's Method is used to approximate the solution of a nonlinear equation such that f(x)=0, which is essentially finding the root of the function by using differentiation. The equation for it is $x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$. This equation generates a sequence, where if the sequence converges it approaches a root of f(x). \n"

The variable x1 which will hold the approximate root value is then initialized to 0, and n is initialized to 1, which is the number of iteration. "

After this calculation, the iteration numbers (n), approximations (x1), and absolute error values are printed. The following if statement allows the while loop to stop after the tolerance is reached."

    "The root of the function is 3.0 and was reached after 6 iterations with an absolute error value of 0. It is evident in this example that as the number of iterations increases, the root becomes more accurate. This is, however, not always the case and there are several factors that affect the number of iterations and accuracy of the approximation, and Newton's Method also fails in some cases. Even though Newton’s Method does not work in all situations and has its limitations, it is still a good tool to use for approximating the roots of a function and often converges to an accurate (or nearly accurate) solution. \n"
